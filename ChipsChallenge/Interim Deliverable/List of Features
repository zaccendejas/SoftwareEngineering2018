Screenshots:
The screenshot I have shows me attempting to display a simple grid to represent the board. However, when trying to
run the start function, I'm unable to get eclipse to run it. So I will have to continue with looking more into how debugging
in eclipse is done properly in order to move forward. In the screenshot it shows that the IDE wants to default to running,
the last assignment, while no main entrance is found for the current project.
